# Minish Cap — Dual Screen

A dual-screen mod of *The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap* for the AYN Thor.
The handheld's bottom panel becomes a live map, quest status and touch
inventory, so the top screen can be nothing but the game.

The dual-screen mod was made with the help of Claude Code and opencode.

Everything on the panel is decoded from your own ROM as the game runs — the
map artwork, the menu chrome, the item icons, the font. No game data is stored
in this repository.

## What's on the panel

- **Map** — Hyrule with a follow cam. ZOOM steps out to the whole kingdom;
  tap a region to open the game's own enlarged map of it. Windcrest warps
  show as pins.
- **Dungeon** — the real automap: floor plaques, explored rooms, Link's
  position, and the small-key count beside your rupees.
- **Quest** — the pause menu's quest screen, reflowed for a square panel. Tap
  the kinstone bag or the technique scroll to open those lists.
- **Items** — tap a ring to arm it, then tap an item to equip that slot.
- **Settings** — hide the top HUD (the panel takes over your vitals), true
  widescreen, and the port-wide toggles the desktop build puts behind F8.

## Install

1. Download the APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/samyost1/tmc-android/releases)
   and install it. It is debug-signed, so Android will warn about an unknown
   developer.
2. Put your own `baserom.gba` (USA, SHA-1 `b4bd50e4131b027c334547b4524e2dbbd4227130`)
   in `Android/data/dev.picori.tmc/files/` on internal storage. For the
   RetroAchievements APK, use `Android/data/dev.picori.tmc.ra/files/`.
3. Launch. The panel appears on the second display automatically.

Built for the Thor, but it is a plain Android `Presentation` — any device with
a second display will do.

## ROM regions

The native port detects the region from the ROM header and switches its data
tables at runtime, so the released USA APK also **loads** a EU (`BZMP`, SHA-1
`cff199b36ff173fb6faf152653d1bccf87c26fb7`) or JP (`BZMJ`) ROM — name it
`baserom_eu.gba` / `baserom_jp.gba` or just `baserom.gba`.

It is not the same as a EU *build*, though. Each APK is compiled against one
region's baseline: the blob-offset headers in `build/<region>/assets/` and the
region `#ifdef`s in `src/` that have not yet been converted to the port's
runtime `REGION_IS_*` form. On a baseline mismatch those compile-time sites
keep following the baseline region, so a USA APK running a EU ROM is a hybrid —
expect region-specific text, menu graphics and RNG to be off. The port logs
which combination it is on startup:

```
$ adb logcat -s tmc | grep 'Region baseline'
Region baseline: build=USA rom=EU (MISMATCH). ...
```

For a faithful EU port, build the EU APK (below). JP additionally needs the
data tables described in `docs/JP_PORT_ENABLEMENT.md`.

## Build from source

Needs the Android SDK and NDK r26. Build both native variants for both ABIs,
then package each variant:

```sh
for variant in vanilla ra; do
  if [ "$variant" = vanilla ]; then
    ra=n
    gradle_task=assembleRelease
  else
    ra=y
    gradle_task=assembleRa
  fi
  for abi in arm64-v8a x86_64; do
    xmake f -y -p android -a "$abi" --ndk="$ANDROID_NDK_HOME" \
        --game_version=USA --gpu_renderer=y --widescreen_width=384 \
        --enable_retroachievements="$ra"
    xmake build -y tmc_pc
  done
  (cd android && ./gradlew --no-daemon ":app:$gradle_task")
done
```

`--widescreen_width=384` is what compiles the wide render paths in; without it
the WIDESCREEN row is hidden because the setting would have nothing to switch.
The vanilla APK is `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` with
package id `dev.picori.tmc`. The RA APK is
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/ra/app-ra.apk` with package id
`dev.picori.tmc.ra`; the two can be installed side by side. CI publishes them
as `tmc-vanilla-android-<version>.apk` and `tmc-ra-android-<version>.apk`.

Swap `--game_version=USA` for `--game_version=EU` to build the EU APK; the
tracked `build/EU/assets/*_offsets.h` mean that is the only change needed. For a
region with no tracked headers (JP, the demos) generate them on the host first —
the Android toolchain cannot produce them, since `asset_processor` has to *run*
on your machine:

```sh
xmake f -P . -y -p linux                     # your host platform
xmake build -P . -y asset_processor
tools/bin/asset_processor extract JP build/JP/assets
```

The build does this for you when it can and otherwise stops with these
instructions, rather than failing on a missing `assets/map_offsets.h`.

For the desktop port, see [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

  port this mod extends (SDL3, software PPU, agbplay audio).
- [Raekwon1603/tmc-android](https://github.com/Raekwon1603/tmc-android) — the
  Android packaging and second-screen scaffold this forked from.

/**
 * The panel itself: one SurfaceView whose native Surface is handed to
 * libmain.so via JNI so C++ can draw into it directly (see
 * port/port_second_screen.c and port/port_second_screen_jni.cpp). This is a
 * separate window/surface from SDLActivity's primary SDLSurface,
 * deliberately not routed through SDL's own event/render pipeline.
 *
 * The view is kept apart from its host because the host varies: normally
 * the panel lives in a {@link SecondScreenPresentation} on the secondary
 * display, but with "swap screens" on the game takes that display and the
 * panel is hosted by {@link SecondScreenActivity} on the main one instead.
 * Only the window setup differs between the two — the surface handoff and
 * the tap forwarding below are the same either way, and there is only ever
 * one of these alive at a time, so native sees the same single surface
 * come and go however it was hosted.
